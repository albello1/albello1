Hello!

My name is Albert and here you have some of the codes of my different projects. The aim of this page is to share with you my research in order to contribute to the global, accessible and fair development of scientific research.

Therefore, here you can find different codes and projects based on the different applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to health. Focusing mainly on machine learning, deep learning and Bayesian data modeling.

I hope you like it!
